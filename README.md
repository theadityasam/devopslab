# DevOpsLab
In the current scenario, DevOps engineers do not have a structured way to share their ideas and garner improvement suggestions on the same. 
Creating a wireframe before beginning to code is an industry-accepted practice in software development and DevOpsLab aims to bring the same structured approach to devops operations. 

Therefore, we intend to build an application that will provide an overview of new or existing network architectures and therefore leading to taking informed and 
calculated decisions.

By using DevOpsLab, teams can create mockups of their cloud architectures, efficiently manage their configuration files, discuss the costs with executives and generate reports for their proposed architecture. This can help small scale businesses in planning out their cloud architectures and expected operational costs, and also medium/large scale businesses to restructure/migrate their existing cloud architectures. 

# Expected Features
- For a specific project multiple people can create branches and present their *version* of their project.
- The architecture can be made by simply dragging and dropping architectural components (eq. K8s, Redis, or custom made servers).
- The platform provides other interested parties the options to preview, suggest changes and raise queries on the design of new architectural plans.
- Providing documentation for the components within the webapp itself. Also, provide developers options to add to the documentations, any company specific details that may prove useful for other developers.
- If the design is actually finalized, then the user also has the option to generate related .yml or .json configuration files for usage.
